USELESS Window Manager Experiments
==================================

Actually This is not a window manager :) . Hopefully one day it will be a minimalistic window manager.

It contains just experiments on xlib development. 

Actually you can find experiments on:

1. Basic event handling
2. Basic keyboard handling
3. Window creation
4. Setting color background
5. Showing Text
6. Setting root window background image
7. Decorating window.

Dependencies
------------
In order to compile this program, you need the following packages installed:

* libx11-dev
* libimlib2-dev

To run correctly it also needs the following program installed:

* xterm

(since it is the only program launched by this useless window manager)

If you want to use Xephyr to test the window manager you need the package: 

* xserver-xephyr (ubuntu) 

installed.

Compile and launch
------------------

```console
    cd src
    make
```

You'll find a release-TAG folder with the binary inside \
And then you can launch it in two different ways:

### Using Xephyr

1. The first is using xephyr,  a tool that launch a X server instance in a window. After installing it (check your distro documentation) type

```console
    Xephyr -screen 1024x768 -br :1
```

Where -screen XxY is the desired resolution. And then you can launch the Window Manager with the following command:

```console
    DISPLAY=:1 ./uwf [ background ]
```

This method is very useful if you want to debug the window manager.

### Launching Full screen

2. The second method is just launching a new server instance, using the following command:

```console
    xinit ./uwf [ background ] -- :1
```

and then you can move between X instances using Ctrl + Alt + Fx

[ background ] is optional, and it specifies the background image. If you don't specify it, a default color will be choosed.

(Using that command a new X instance will be launched, and you don't need to close the running server)

Tested image formats:

* jpg

Please notice that the background argument is optional. 

Usage instruction
-----------------
There are very few thing that you can do using this useless window manager, here a list of what you can do:

* Press 1 to launch xterm (and with xterm you can launch other programs)
* To close a program just right click on program window decoration.

You need to create a 30x30 default.bmp file in the main project folder (it will be fixed in the future)

TODO
----

* Add a window destroy event handler (DONE)
* Basic configuration handling (background color/image and default terminal)
* Scale background image
* Finish work on text drawing functions
* Add better argument parsing.
* Fix issue #2 (DONE)
